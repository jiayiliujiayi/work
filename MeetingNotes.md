**04.05 Tue Meeting w/ Dr. Kreimer**  
- activators/repressors: add "filter" (F1-F4) criterias
- for pertX, wilcox test on:
	- positive
	- negative
	- overall
	- (also considering filters)
- add n_gained vs n_lost to slides
- discussion about joining the lab

**04.01, Fri, Meeting w/ Dr. Li**    
- manuscript:   
	- focus on same cell number scenarios  
	- add toy examples for methods part  
	- big picture: evaluation  
- check: under SCT, gene variance changed?   
- check: variance vs cell number in denSNE manuscript   

**03.29 Tue Meeting w/ Dr. Kreimer**  
- For the perturbed/not perturbed motifs, check if they have 
 overlapped/not overlapped identical motifs  
- what does each F mean?   
- what does Filt mean?   
- gained/lost motifs: activators or repressors?   
- delta $nMotif_{pert - WT}$ --> positive or negative?   

**03.25 Meeting w/ Dr. Li**  
- should keep an eye on Type I Errors  
- Todo  
	- Try different cell number scenario:   
		- condition 1: 100cells/type
		- condition 2: 100-1000cells/type
	- Update manuscripts

**03.24 Meeting w/ Dr. Kreimer**
- Fisher's test for subgroups? 
	- crosstable, chi-square? 
- add raw numbers of motifs
- Wilcox on F=0 motifs
