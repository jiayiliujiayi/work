#scRNA-SeqVariability 
- different cell number/type scenario: 
	- method 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
	- something wrong with 13, eg: 
```bash
[[985]]
[1] "Error in file(outfile, \"rb\") : cannot open the connection\n"
attr(,"class")
[1] "try-error"
attr(,"condition")
<simpleError in file(outfile, "rb"): cannot open the connection>
```
